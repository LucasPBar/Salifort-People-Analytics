This project was developed as part of the **Google Data Advanced Analytics** certification to apply data science and machine learning techniques in predicting employee turnover at the fictional company *Salifort Motors*. 

The HR department at Salifort Motors has collected employee data with the goal of improving satisfaction and retention but is uncertain about how to leverage this information. They sought the expertise of a data analytics professional to provide data-driven insights and answer a crucial question: **What factors are likely to cause employees to leave the company?**

## Project Objective
The main goal is to analyze the dataset provided by HR and build a predictive model that identifies employees who are likely to leave. By forecasting turnover, the company can proactively address the root causes, enhancing employee satisfaction and retention.

Reducing employee turnover is essential because recruiting, interviewing, and training new staff is both time-consuming and costly. Effective retention strategies not only stabilize the workforce but also optimize the company’s investment in talent development.

## Project Structure
- **data/**: Dataset used for analysis.
- **notebooks/**: Exploratory data analysis, visualizations, and model experiments.
- **src/**: Scripts for data preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation.
- **README.md**: Project documentation.

## Dataset Overview
The dataset contains information on 15,000 employees, including features such as satisfaction level, performance evaluation, number of projects, monthly working hours, time spent at the company, work accidents, promotions in the last five years, department, salary level, and turnover status.

## Techniques Applied
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualizations with Matplotlib and Seaborn
- Classification models such as Logistic Regression and Random Forest
- Evaluation metrics including AUC, F1-score, Precision, and Recall
- Cross-validation to ensure model robustness

## Ethical Considerations
This project also reflects on the responsible use of sensitive data, emphasizing privacy, transparency, and bias mitigation throughout the analysis and modeling process.
