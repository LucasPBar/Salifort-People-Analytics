## Project Description

This project was developed as part of the Google Data Advanced Analytics certification to apply data science and machine learning techniques in predicting employee turnover at the fictional company Salifort Motors. The HR department at Salifort Motors has gathered comprehensive employee data aiming to enhance workforce satisfaction and retention. However, they faced uncertainty about how to extract actionable insights from this data. They engaged a data analytics professional to deliver data-driven answers to a key question: which factors are most likely to lead employees to leave the company?

## Business Problem & Objectives

### Business Problem  
The HR team at Salifort Motors wants to understand the underlying causes that prompt employees to leave the company. Employee turnover not only disrupts team dynamics but also incurs significant financial and operational costs. Therefore, identifying predictive factors that signal an employee‚Äôs likelihood of leaving is essential. With these insights, the company can proactively create targeted strategies to enhance employee satisfaction, reduce turnover rates, and foster a healthier workplace culture.

### Objectives  
- Analyze the dataset to uncover key turnover drivers  
- Build a predictive model that flags employees at risk of leaving  
- Provide HR with actionable, data-driven recommendations for retention strategies  

---

## Proposed Solutions

1. **Reduce excessive workload:** Limit projects per employee and monitor burnout signs.  
2. **Promotions and recognition:** Establish clear policies to reward and retain talent.  
3. **Work culture reform:** Reevaluate performance metrics and overtime practices.  
4. **HR strategic engagement:** Facilitate team discussions to identify dissatisfaction drivers.  
5. **Feature engineering:** Create derived variables like ‚Äúoverworked‚Äù to better capture workload stress.  
6. **Adopt predictive models:** Implement Random Forest to identify turnover risk and guide interventions.

## Ethical Considerations

This project reflects the responsible use of sensitive employee data by emphasizing:  
- **Privacy:** Ensuring data confidentiality throughout analysis  
- **Transparency:** Clear communication about data usage and model limitations  
- **Bias Mitigation:** Identifying and reducing biases to promote fair predictions

## Key Business Insights

| Indicator                 | Insight                                                                                   |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Satisfaction Level        | Low satisfaction is the strongest predictor of turnover.                                 |
| Workload                  | More than 200 hours/month is linked to dissatisfaction and burnout.                      |
| Number of Projects        | Ideal range is 3 to 4 projects; 7 projects correlate with 100% turnover.                 |
| Tenure                    | Employees with over 6 years tend to stay; 4-year tenure group shows unusual dissatisfaction. |
| Promotions                | Promotions correlate with higher retention but are infrequent.                           |
| Performance Evaluations   | Should not rely solely on hours worked to avoid rewarding overwork.                      |

## Models and Metrics

| Model               | Accuracy | Recall (Leavers) | Precision (Leavers) |
|---------------------|----------|------------------|---------------------|
| Logistic Regression  | 82%      | 26%              | 44%                 |
| Decision Tree       | 94%      | 92%              | 78%                 |
| Random Forest       | 96%      | 90%              | 87%                 |

*Why Random Forest?*  
- Combines multiple trees for robustness  
- Captures complex variable interactions  
- Maintains stability with unseen data
